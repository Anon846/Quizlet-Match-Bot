To-do/plans for future
======

*(This is in an unordered list but it's basically ordered by what will get done first)*
* Make it so that the bot goes through the entire teacher's list of units/lesson.
* Hack up a system so that it can be running on any system, and refresh the teacher's list every minute or so.
* Add multiple teachers to the list
