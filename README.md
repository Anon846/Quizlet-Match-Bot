# Quizlet-Match-Bot 

You can find the demo here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76W5WLUvEWw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76W5WLUvEWw).

I am making this bot so that I can get a super high score on Quizlet, on the match part.

This isn't really a serious project (even though it is) and it was just created to brag to people about stupid high scores on something that doesn't matter. :octocat:

Right now only Windows is supported. It is planned to add Linux support soon.

## Get started.


You can just download that boy.py file and then run it. You'll need to install some packages, and then it'll get running. **Important: you'll NEED to put you're geckodriver executable into your Documents folder, whether you're on Windows, or Linux (at least for the moment until I fix stuff).** It'll first prompt for your Quizlet username, then your password (no characters will show up for privacy and security reasons), and then you'll have to paste a URL of a teacher on Quizlet who has some lessons. When you run the program, a browser window should pop-up, and if it does, then you're probably good.

## Questions


*(I made these myself)*

> This is just a stupid piece of code that gets you a meaningless high score. Why do you act like it is such a big and important project?

I acknowledge all of that. I literally made this so that I could "brag" to other people about my high score. I am only working on it for the coding part of it. It seriously is fun to optimize a piece of software that achieves it's goal, even if it's just a stupid web bot. As of this moment I am not working on any other projects, so I guess I will just keep working on this.

> Dude why aren't you updating every day?

I'm not because I like to do other things too. Also, because sometimes it gets boring.

> What the heck is going on why doesn't this exactly work?

It don't work because I am not a robot that's been perfectly programmed.

*I will conjure up some more questions soon.*
