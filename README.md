# Quizlet-Match-Bot 🎅🎄🎁🔔🎅🎄🎁🔔
======
I am making this bot so that I can get a super high score on Quizlet, on the match part. 🚀

This isn't really a serious 😑 project (even though it is) and it was just created to brag to people 😎 about stupid high scores on something that doesn't matter. :octocat:

Right now only Windows is supported (🐧😥). It is planned to add Linux support soon.

## Get started. 💪👏
======

You can just download that boy.py file and then run it. You'll need to install some packages, and then it'll get running. It'll first prompt for your Quizlet username, then your password (no characters will show up for privacy and security reasons), and then you'll have to paste a URL of a teacher on Quizlet who has some lessons. If you want just to test this bot out, you can use some I made on my profile, over at [https://quizlet.com/Sean6500](https://quizlet.com/Sean6500). A browser window should pop-up, and if it does, then you're probably good.

## Questions 😵
======

*(I made these myself)*

> This is just a stupid piece of code that gets you a meaningless high score. Why do you act like it is such a big and important project?

I acknowledge all of that. I literally made this so that I could "brag" to other people about my high score. I am only working on it for the coding part of it. It seriously is fun to optimize a piece of software that achieves it's goal, even if it's just a stupid web bot. As of this moment I am not working on any other projects, so I guess I will just keep working on this.

*I will conjure up some more questions soon.*
