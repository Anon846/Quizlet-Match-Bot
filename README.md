# Quizlet-Match-Bot 

I am making this bot so that I can get a super high score on Quizlet, on the match part.

This isn't really a serious project (even though it is) and it was just created to brag to people about stupid high scores on something that doesn't matter.

Right now only Windows is supported. It is planned to add Linux support soon.

## Get started.


You can just download that boy.py file and then run it. You'll need to install some packages, and then it'll get running. **Important: you'll NEED to put you're geckodriver executable into your Documents folder, whether you're on Windows, or Linux (at least for the moment until I fix stuff).** It'll first prompt for your Quizlet username, then your password (no characters will show up for privacy and security reasons), and then you'll have to paste a URL of a teacher on Quizlet who has some lessons. When you run the program, a browser window should pop-up, and if it does, then you're probably good.
