This will get you the respect you (might) want, b1tches

Windows only, b1tches

## Get started.

You can just download that boy.py file and then run it. You'll need to install some packages, and then it'll get running. **Important: you'll NEED to put your geckodriver executable into your Documents folder, whether you're on Windows, or Linux (at least for the moment until I fix stuff).** It'll first prompt for your Quizlet username, then your password (no characters will show up for privacy and security reasons), and then you'll have to paste a URL of a teacher on Quizlet who has some lessons. When you run the program, a browser window should pop-up, and if it does, then you're probably good.
